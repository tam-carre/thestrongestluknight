# thestrongestluknight.com

[This website](https://thestrongestluknight.com/) was made for the retirement of YouTube streamer Kiryuu Coco.

It is written in React + TypeScript + SCSS.

Following Coco's sudden announcement, the website was created under a nerve-wracking deadline with the help of many community members as credited. [The issue tracker](https://github.com/tam-carre/thestrongestluknight/issues?q=is%3Aissue+is%3Aclosed) now serves as a memory of the rushed organizing process I carried out.

I am greatly satisfied with the slick and performant outcome. Though the code was quite messy on release, I've since then been able to clean it up significantly.


### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.\
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!
