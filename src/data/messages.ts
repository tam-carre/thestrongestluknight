Rest assured the young princess will be taken care of while you soar the skies and you should know that you will never be forgotten and your legacy will span generations for you are an amazing dragon! Legendary in stature and fame. I didn't know you well, but through the young princess I have come to know you. This isn't farewell; this is til we meet again! 頑張ってと大好き！",

It was somewhat poetic or like straight out of a fairy tale that a dragon, standing tall, proud, but goofy, has behind her a sweet little Princess. And ever since that chance meeting, I have become a loyal and a full-fledged Luknight. Thank you, Coco, for all the hard work and for bridging us overseas fans to the world of Hololive. It will not be the same without you. Thank you Coco and we will always miss you.",
